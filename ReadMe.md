# 🎮 Color Match

**Color Match** is a fast-paced reflex game built with Unity.

The goal is simple: Match the displayed color by clicking the correct button as fast as you can.  
Each correct click gives you +1 point. Each wrong click deducts a point.  
The game ends after 60 seconds — how high can you score?
